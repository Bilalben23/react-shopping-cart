# Shopping Cart React Project

## Overview
This project is a simple yet functional shopping cart built with React, utilizing data fetched from an external API. The application offers a smooth user experience with dynamic product management, including adding items to the cart, adjusting quantities, and viewing the cart's total. The UI is designed using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive layout, and **Redux Toolkit** is employed for efficient global state management.

## Features
- **Product Listing**: Products are fetched from an external API and displayed in a responsive grid layout.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart directly from the product list.
- **Cart Management**: Users can view their cart, including all added products, and see the total cost.
- **Quantity Adjustment**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each product in their cart.
- **Skeleton Loaders**: During the loading phase, skeletons are displayed to indicate that content is being fetched, enhancing the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage global state and synchronize data across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first CSS design.
- **API Integration**: To fetch product data and display it dynamically.

## Key Learnings
During the development of this project, I gained significant experience in:
- **API Calls**: Fetching data from external sources and displaying it effectively in the UI.
- **State Management**: Utilizing `useState` and `useEffect` hooks alongside **Redux Toolkit** for managing application state globally.
- **UI Design**: Designing a clean, responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Skeleton Loading States**: Implementing skeleton loaders to improve user experience during data fetching.

## Preview
Here is a preview of the project in action, showcasing the UI and key features:

- **Cart View**: Viewing added products, adjusting quantities, and seeing the total cost.
